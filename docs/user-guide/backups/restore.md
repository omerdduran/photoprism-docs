# Restoring Backups

To restore your instance, you must have the files in [your *originals* folder](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#photoprismoriginals) and a copy of the index database. We also recommend [having a backup](index.md) of [the *storage* folder](../../getting-started/docker-compose.md#photoprismstorage) so that you don't need to recreate any thumbnail or sidecar files, and your backup includes the complete configuration:

- if you have a backup copy of your *storage* and *originals* folders, the easiest way is to restore those folders first and then run the restore command in case you are using MariaDB
- otherwise, you additionally need to perform a [complete rescan of your library](../../user-guide/library/originals.md) to recreate missing sidecar and thumbnail files
- some of the metadata and your albums can also be [recovered from YAML sidecar files](export.md) even if you don't have a copy of the index database, unless you have [disabled this feature](../../getting-started/config-options.md#feature-flags)

## Restore Command

To restore the index from an existing MariaDB dump, you can run the following command:

```
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism restore -i -f
```

If you are using Podman on a Red Hat-compatible Linux distribution:

```
podman-compose exec photoprism photoprism restore -i -f
```

This will automatically search the backup folder for the most recent index dump and restore it. A custom backup base folder can be configured with [`PHOTOPRISM_BACKUP_PATH`](../../getting-started/config-options.md#storage).

Omit the `-f` flag to prevent overwriting an existing index. As with the backup command, you can also specify a specific dump filename as an argument:

```
docker compose exec photoprism photoprism restore -i [filename]
```

When the database is restored, all user accounts and passwords are restored as well. If you have changed your password, you must thus use the old password to sign in.

    Note that our examples use the new `docker compose` command by default. If your server does not yet support it, you can still use `docker-compose` or alternatively `podman-compose` on Red Hat-compatible distributions.

## MariaDB Server Migration

For detailed information on how to move your [MariaDB database](folders.md#database) to another server or virtual machine, please see the [Server Migration](../../getting-started/troubleshooting/mariadb.md#server-migration) section of our [MariaDB Troubleshooting Guide](../../getting-started/troubleshooting/mariadb.md).
