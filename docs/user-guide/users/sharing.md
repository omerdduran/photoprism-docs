# Sharing Albums with Guests

Users with the [Admin](roles.md#admin) or [User role](roles.md#user) can [create secret links](../share/index.md) to share [manually created albums](../organize/albums.md) as well as selected [Moments](../organize/moments.md), [Months](../organize/calendar.md), [States](../search/index.md#states), or [Folders](../organize/folders.md) with [other accounts](roles.md#guest). This works the same as sharing with users who do not have an account.

When authenticated users with limited privileges, such as [Guests](roles.md#guest), open a share link, they gain permanent read-only access to the shared items until the link is removed or expires.

!!! tldr ""
    In a future release, you will be able to share content with local users directly from the web interface without having to [create links](../share/index.md) first.
