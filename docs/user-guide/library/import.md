# Importing Files to Originals #

!!! tldr ""
    Most users with an existing library will want to [index their originals](originals.md) directly without using the optional import feature, leaving the file and folder names unchanged. Importing first copies or moves from their source directory to the *originals* folder, which is optional.

## Manual Import

1. Add files to the *import* folder if not done already

2. Go to *Library* using the main navigation, and open the *Import* tab

3. Select a sub-folder or keep the default to import all files

4. Select *Move Files* if you want imported files to be removed from the *import* folder

5. Click on *Import*

!!! tip ""
    You may use [WebDAV](webdav.md) for adding files to the *import* folder.
    This is especially helpful if PhotoPrism is running on a remote server.

!!! danger ""
    Import is not possible in [read-only mode](../settings/library.md) because it requires [write permissions](../../getting-started/troubleshooting/docker.md#file-permissions) to the folder of *originals*.

### When should "Move Files" be selected?

If you select this option, files that have been moved to the *originals* folder, or that already exist, will be automatically deleted from the *import* folder.
This way you save disk space if you don't want to keep them as backup or for other reasons.

## Automatic Import

Automatic imports are disabled by default, as a wrong configuration or unsupported usage can cause files or sets of files to be imported incompletely, e.g. if you are using a slow or unreliable Internet connection, which is of particular concern with [large video or RAW files](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/4310).

If you enable automatic imports by setting the config option [`PHOTOPRISM_AUTO_IMPORT`](../../getting-started/config-options.md#indexing) to a positive number indicating the safety delay in seconds, an import is automatically triggered after the safety delay when files are added to the *import* folder [via WebDAV](../sync/webdav.md).

!!! info "Can I use PhotoPrism to sort files into a configurable folder structure?"
    You have complete freedom in how you organize your originals. If you don't like the unique names and
    folders used by the import function, you can resort to external batch renaming tools, for example:

    * [ExifTool](https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/exiftool-commands.html#rename)
    * [PhockUp](https://github.com/ivandokov/phockup)
    * [Photo Organizer](https://www.systweak.com/photo-organizer)

    Configurable import folders may be available in a later version. This is because - depending on the specific 
    pattern - appropriate conflict resolution is required and the patterns must be well understood and validated
    to avoid typos or other misconfigurations that lead to undesired results for which we do not want to be responsible.
