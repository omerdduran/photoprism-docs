# Image Orientation

## Using Exiftool

Assuming you have Docker installed and want to run [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) with Debian 12 "Bookworm", you can simply run this command to open a terminal:

```bash
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/test -w /test -ti debian:bookworm bash
```

This will mount the current working directory as `/test`. Of course, you can also specify a full path instead of `${PWD}`.

The available Ubuntu, Debian and PhotoPrism images can be found on Docker Hub:

- https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu
- https://hub.docker.com/_/debian
- https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism/tags

Now install `exiftool` and any other packages you need, e.g. `libheif-examples` to convert HEIF images to JPEG, via `apt`:

```bash
apt update
apt install -y exiftool libheif-examples
```

To view the image metadata, run `exiftool -n <filename>` and optionally use grep to filter the output:

```
root@1ad9fb887a4f:/test# exiftool -n IMG_8437.HEIC.jpg | grep ation
File Modification Date/Time     : 2022:09:18 08:16:28+00:00
Orientation                     : 6
Exposure Compensation           : 0
root@1ad9fb887a4f:/test# exiftool -n IMG_8437.HEIC | grep ation
File Modification Date/Time     : 2022:09:17 16:57:40+00:00
Orientation                     : 6
Exposure Compensation           : 0
HEVC Configuration Version      : 1
Min Spatial Segmentation IDC    : 0
Rotation                        : 270
```

**Rotation** and **Orientation** are the important values you should pay attention to and compare. The rotation is in degrees.

## Exiftool Parameters

- `-n` displays the raw values without changes
- `-j` will format the output as JSON
- `-g` groups the output by metadata source

## Exif Values

The numbers used to specify the image orientation are defined as follows: 

1. = 0 degrees: the correct orientation, no adjustment is required.
2. = 0 degrees, mirrored: image has been flipped back-to-front.
3. = 180 degrees: image is upside down.
4. = 180 degrees, mirrored: image has been flipped back-to-front and is upside down.
5. = 90 degrees: image has been flipped back-to-front and is on its side.
6. = 90 degrees, mirrored: image is on its side.
7. = 270 degrees: image has been flipped back-to-front and is on its far side.
8. = 270 degrees, mirrored: image is on its far side.
