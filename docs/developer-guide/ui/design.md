**We strive for a user interface that is clutter-free, well-organized, and doesn't behave in unexpected ways. It should work across a wide range of devices and be easy to use for everyone.**

## Theme Colors

![Sample](img/violet.jpg){ align=right class=w20 }

The colors we use should be consistent and functional, for example, provide sufficient contrast. For the included themes, the preferred primary colors are violet and cyan, but other colors can be used as well.

*To avoid distorting the visual impression of photos and videos, large background areas should generally be neutral or just slightly saturated.*

## Context Menu

The context menu at the bottom right should use a color spectrum for the individual actions to reflect the spectral colors of a prism:

## Icon Fonts

We stick to Google's Material icons and use other icons only when absolutely necessary:
