Open a terminal and type `photoprism start` to start the built-in server. It will listen on [localhost:2342](http://localhost:2342/) by default, see [compose.yaml](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/compose.yaml) and [Configuration](../configuration.md).

## Frameworks ##

[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start) is a powerful open-source [Material Design](https://material.io/) UI component framework for building modern single-page applications.

It is based on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), a JavaScript library that combines the best ideas from [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (Google) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Facebook); development is community driven and the API fairly stable.

Vuetify and VueJS are initialized in [frontend/src/app.js](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/frontend/src/app.js). [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) is used as a module loader / bundler. It creates single, optimized JS and CSS files in the server assets public build directory from the original source code. You can find the build configuration in `frontend/webpack.config.js`.

For our docs and landing pages, we may use https://materializecss.com/ as a lightweight alternative to Vuetify.

## Components ##

Components are reusable user-interface widgets. [UI Components](components.md) contains a list of custom components. Standard components like [buttons](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/buttons) or [forms](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/forms) are well documented on [vuetifyjs.com](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/quick-start).

## Dependencies ##

The full list of dependencies can be found in `frontend/package.json`. You need to run `npm install` in the **frontend directory** to install them (automatically happens during installation, see `Makefile`). Run `npm install -P [package name]` to add a new package (library or framework).

## Building ##

A build can be triggered by running `npm run watch` (watches for changes and re-builds when needed) or `npm run build` (single build) in the **frontend directory**. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the default package manager that comes with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/), a JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
